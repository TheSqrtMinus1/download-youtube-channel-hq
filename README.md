# download-youtube-channel-hq


Downloads every video from a specific youtube channel to a new directory named after the channel you download. (i.e. if you download PewDiePie's videos, they go into the directory "./PewDiePie" ) 

Since it uses youtube-dl as backend, I set it to download only the highest quality, which unfortunately turns out to not always be mp4 files.

Because of this, I commented in some code to convert the finished mkv files into mp4 files.
